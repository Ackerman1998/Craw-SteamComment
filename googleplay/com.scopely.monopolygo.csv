Jodi Bishop,Thus game is amazing! But the bad thing about it is you cannot trade gold cards which you should be able to do. Other than that there are no ads and it's a very addicting game I do recommend!,5,2023-08-21 17:07:04,

sis short,"it's a great game but i think a room for improvement is that the part where we collect tokens on the tiles, currently it's the flag one. i think when the timer runs out and one has collected so much of it yet didn't have enough time to complete the course, i think it would be great if you compensate those extra tokens with something like money or dice rolls as it would be very devastating for someone to collect so much but end up couldn't achieve the reward due to time constraints.",3,2023-08-21 15:55:11,1.8.0

Becky McBeth,"Last week, there were technical issues,which resulted in me not being able to play and losing money and landmarks getting destroyed. Scopely decided to compensate people but in a very unfair way. Some people were given pink sticker packs and 200 dice ,but others like myself who played daily and spent money on the game were given 25-30 dice, which is unfair. Also, not being able to trade gold stickers sucks when all you get is duplicates of what you already have. Been waiting on 1 gold sticker.",2,2023-08-21 14:18:40,1.8.0

K&J Nation,"I like the game, although I must say it gets annoying to have to wait an hour to 8 dice. I understand is no difference then say Candy Crush , having to wait a time to get a life but they're to separate games with different lay outs etc. Gold stickers should be able to be traded as well as not having so many duplicates back to back. From my understanding after adding a certain amount of friends, you get ""capped"" and it's even harder to get the in game free dice. I enjoy playing though.",4,2023-08-21 14:05:16,

I just have 2 things that keep me from rating higher: 1) The games freezes/lags several times while I'm playing. Earlier it completely froze while I was trying to roll to get out of jail. 2) The amount of duplicate stickers collected is insane! It makes it way too difficult to complete each album.

Cool game if you have thousands to spend. There is also no way to control your playing. Everything is fixed. There's no way to tell if your rolls or moves do anything at all. It's all fixed. Trust me. Edit: I've uninstalled the game. All it does is lure you in to spend money. They do a really good job trying to get you to bite. By Monopoly",1,2023-08-21 12:16:08,1.7.0

skylar and Alex Bird,I would have given this a 5 star if I rated when I first started but playing it for awhile I noticed the game is very rigged. Almost impossible to get all the stickers unless you go on and beg ppl to help you. Plus 6 dice an hour is ridiculous. You're going to lose a lot of players.,2,2023-08-21 09:04:04,1.8.0

Dan Eldredge,"had the app installed for several weeks, and it got impossible to advance to the higher levels. 6 dice rolls every hour is a waste of time! Ads selling dice rolls, money, and stickers are numerous and annoying. If they gave you a dice roll for every ad they popped up, you might have a chance to advance......",1,2023-08-21 09:01:43,

Matthew Scholten,"Alright people read this before installing. The complete the sticker album challenge, I spent more than 250 Australian dollars on this game, maybe an hour per day of my time, and never have I ever completed the challenge. Doesn't matter how much money or time you spend on it, how many blue/purple/black sticker packs you open the ""new"" stickers will stop coming. I'm really annoyed I spent all that time and money and at the end of the day (challenge) you have nothing to show for it. RIGGED!!!",1,2023-08-21 08:50:06,1.8.0

It doesn't make sense and doesn't seems fair. I don't even want to get started on the gold stickers, I have 9+ of the same gold card.

Nathan Bright,"It's an okay timewaster, but the die rolls are clearly fixed. I land on at least two of the corner spaces during every trip around the board. I will almost always land in the Jail corner which serves literally no purpose in this game beyond eating dice. When you need to land on the Tax spaces to pick up event tokens you never will, but you'll hit them frequently any other time. I also go to jail every other go around and I have never once rolled doubles to get out. I always have to pay.",3,2023-08-21 08:47:56,1.8.0

Harper Evans (MoonBunny),"TOO MANY POP UPS! It's so annoying that every single damn time you run out of dice it try to sell you more by having a in app purchases pop up wanting you to buy more dice. And I mean every time so say you got like 450 dice, you put the multipler on 100. You roll the dice 4 time and even though you still have 50 dice it's like uh oh your running out of dice want to buy more. It should lower the multipler automatically as the dice rolls.",3,2023-08-21 07:44:18,1.8.0

Jenn R,I've been playing this game for a while now. It's supposed to be a fun game but let's be honest it actually stresses people out who play it. There's many things wrong with this game. Some of the biggest issues with this game is the way it gives you the stickers or cards to collect in order to win small prizes. If you can't get them on your own which is almost impossible to get what you need I have more extras than the actual cards I need! I have more to say but not enough space!,1,2023-08-21 06:31:22,1.8.0

alisha cullen,"Use to love this game but can't get ahead only 8 dice an hour max and takes weeks on end to collect an album set, gold cards are impossible can't trade em, when you do get sticker packs, nothing worth trading 8/10 it's a 1 or 2 star getting bored quicker",3,2023-08-21 06:29:43,1.8.0

Luminoux,"The game was fun for awhile, but there are many factors that make it quite a bad experience. When bank heisting, we can only heist our added friends for small sums, but the game allows random to heist us for our entire bank or x100 or more of what we can heist. In events those that dont pay for dice are constantly losing to those with many dice and those that would pay to get dice thus being very far behind. They make it hard to obtain 4* and 5* stickers but sticker trading is quite bad too",2,2023-08-21 05:56:25,1.8.0

Its an okay game, but you have no opportunity to win extra dice and you only get 7 free dice per hour no matter what level you're on.

. N8SMITHY,"I've been playing for a few months, and it gets very repetitive. The price of everything goes up, yet the rewards are the same as when you first started to play. It's a money pit, ad after ad to purchase dice and stickers, yet you never get to complete the albums, and trading them is a joke. It gives you stickers you've already traded.

But if you're looking for something that's fun, easy, can be played with friends, and doesn't force you to buy stuff, it's good.

Paulla Fetzek,"Game is fun for... maybe... 50 levels. Then it's frustrating. Good luck advancing without buying one of their packages - which of course aren't inexpensive. The sticker concept is ridiculous. What's the point in having more than one Gold if you can't trade? And completing the albums? Extremely difficult to do - especially the ones that offer great rewards. Finally, only a 50 dice reward after each level completed? Not worth the time or money for extended playing.",2,2023-08-21 00:31:23,1.8.0

Ronda Prettyman,The game is extremely frustrating. As you level up your costs get higher but your rewards for leveling up do not. The stickers everyone is trying to collect are too hard to get. You play for weeks get up to higher levels but are still only getting 1 and 2 star cards. I know it is a ploy to get you to buy more dice or sticker packs from them but it is ridiculous. People are selling the most needed stickers on Ebay or scamming people to get what they need. DO BETTER SCOPELY!!!!!!,1,2023-08-21 00:13:40,1.8.0

Notice how it seems to always thread the needle on things you may need, then gives you 5 pop-ups about microtransactions once you run out of rolls. You could be a step away from what you need, giving you that incentive to buy from them. It's a little fun but a lot of it is ruined due to this.
